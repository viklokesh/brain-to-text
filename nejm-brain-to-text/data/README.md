Data can be downloaded from Dryad, [here](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.dncjsxm85). Please download this data and place it in the `data` directory before running the code. Be sure to unzip `t15_copyTask_neuralData.zip` and `t15_pretrained_rnn_baseline.zip`.

`t15_copyTaskData_description.csv` contains a block-by-block description of the Copy Task data, including the session date, block number, number of trials, the corpus used, and what split the data is in (train, val, or test). This file is not required for running the code, but it may be useful for understanding the data.
